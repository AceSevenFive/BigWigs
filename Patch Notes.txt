Developer:
	- Separation of Concerns: Complete overhaul of the architecture of all boss modules to separate internationalization, event handling and front-end (bars, messages, etc.). This also allows multi-server support
	- CombatlogFilter Plugin: eases combatlog parsing and allows for quicker changes
	
New:
	- Skeram: Added a bar for Arcane Explosion
	- Autoreply Plugin: Whispers you receive during a bossfight will be automatically answered with a message that you are currently busy and the current status can be queried by whispering "status". Another message will be send as soon as the fight ends.
	- AFKick Plugin: Allows the raid leader and the assistants to send a request automatically logout a raid member. If the player does not react within 20 seconds a normal Logout will be triggered. If the logout did not work the client will be closed after another 20 seconds.
	- Bar Color Scheme: Defined a uniform color scheme with defined colors for certain events: 
		- Berserk/Enrage: Red
		- Fear: Orange
		- Frenzy: Yellow
		- Next Frenzy: White
		- Interruptebale casts: Blue
		- Mind Control: Purple
		- Phase Changes/Very Important Events: Black
	
Fixes:
	- Module reboot requests from someone with an non english client are working now
	- Chromaggus: Show Vulnerability on bar
	- C'Thun: Improved the Flesh Tentacle health bars
