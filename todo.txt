Important:
- improve configuration for warnicon

	- hp bar color coded (green: over 3% ahead, orange: within 3% of enrage, red: over 3% behind)

- interrupt plugin:
	- list of names with a bar right of the name. the bar shows the cooldown of the interrupt skill or if it's available.
	- configuration which classes should be shown
