- enrage plugin: 
	
	- show 2 bars on top of each other. one for the enrage timer and one with the boss hp.
	
	- hp bar color coded (green: over 3% ahead, orange: within 3% of enrage, red: over 3% behind)

- interrupt plugin:
 
	- list of names with a bar right of the name. the bar shows the cooldown of the interrupt skill or if it's available.
 
	- configuration which classes should be shown
